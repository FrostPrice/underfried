# Multi-Agent Systems

## Description

This project is a simulation of multi-agent systems using the JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework). It demonstrates how agents can interact, communicate, and collaborate to achieve their goals.

For this project, we have implemented a simple scenario where multiple agents work at a kitchen restaurant and chaos ensues.

This was based on the game [Overcooked](https://ghosttowngames.com/game/overcooked/).

## Setting up the Environment

### JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework)

Download the JADE framework from [JADE](https://jade.tilab.com/download/jade/).

Unzip either the bin (recommended) or the code version (needs to be compiled).

### Running JADE

On linux terminal:

```bash
java -classpath ./jade/lib/jade.jar jade.Boot -gui
```

On windows:

```text
I don't know. Its windows, probably will have to configure its awfull classpath system variable.
```
